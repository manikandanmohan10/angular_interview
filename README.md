## Answers
1. Typescript: <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled programming language
that builds on JavaScript. It is a superset of the JavaScript language, designed to give you better tooling at any scale.
2. JS vs TS: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development. It lets 
you create interactive and dynamic features on websites. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected errors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TypeScript is like a "supercharged" version of JavaScript. It adds extra rules that
 help catch mistakes before your code runs, making your programs more reliable. It's especially useful for larger projects where avoiding errors is important. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, JavaScript is powerful but can be error-prone, while TypeScript adds
 extra safety to your code.
